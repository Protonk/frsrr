\usage{
frsr_phase(
  phases = 128L,
  exponents = -62L:62L,
  per_cell = 64L,
  magics = c(1596980000L, 1598050000L),
  q = 0.95,
  NRmax = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phases}{Number of equally sized phase bins spanning `[0, 1)`. Must be
a positive integer.}

\item{exponents}{Integer vector of unbiased exponents. Values must keep the
generated floats in the normalized range (i.e. `[-126, 127]`).}

\item{per_cell}{Samples to generate for each `(phase, exponent)` cell.}

\item{magics}{Integer vector of candidate magic constants to evaluate.}

\item{q}{Quantile applied to the absolute relative errors inside each phase.
Must satisfy `0 < q <= 1`.}

\item{NRmax}{Newton steps applied through [`frsr0()`]. Reuses existing
Newton logic; the default sticks with the raw restoring constant path.}
}
\value{
`frsr_phase()` returns a list with components:
\describe{
  \item{magic}{Chosen magic constant (integer).}
  \item{J}{Objective value, i.e. the maximum quantile across phases.}
  \item{R}{Mean absolute difference between consecutive phase-wise mean errors.}
  \item{phase_tbl}{Data frame with the per-phase quantile, mean, median, and
    sample count.}
  \item{heat}{A matrix indexed by exponents x phases storing per-cell median
    signed errors, suitable for plotting.}
}
}
\description{
Stratifies floating-point samples by exponent and phase
(fractional log2) bins, evaluates every candidate magic constant, and returns
the magic that minimizes the worst phase-wise tail error. Statistics
are returned to help diagnose phase bias.
}
\details{
log2 phases are a useful way to this function as it contains a
linear approximation to log2 whose performance varies greatly
depending on proximity to powers of two.
